# TEXT-TO-IMAGE
The integration of speech recognition and attention GAN for converting speech to text and generating images from the text using advanced algorithms like RNNs and CNNs. The attention GAN model, consisting of generator and discriminator, then creates realistic images based on the transcribed text.
